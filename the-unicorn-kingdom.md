## The Unicorn Kingdom

Alan woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray. After his typical 
breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school. Normally Alan would 
have walked down Bleaker street but today there was construction and 
he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo. 

Being on time was not one of Alan’s specialities today would prove to 
be no different. As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees 
and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind 
the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance. Alan had 
heard all of this before but today there was a new sound sort of a 
cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet. He stopped 
to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar. 

Normally Alan would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that 
an animal might escape. He stuck his head in the door, the color of 
the foliage was intense greens, browns and yellows, he called out for 
a zoo keeper but got no response. The smell of the of the zoo was 
intense and alive. He took a tentative step through the door and 
followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns. 

Alan met the unicorn King the end.
